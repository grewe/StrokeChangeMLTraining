##  StrokeChange Detection ONLY implementation training

### StrokeChange-6-classes.ipynb  (detection via Tensorflow Model Maker )
= colab to use Tensorflow Model Maker to train an EfficientDet D0 - LITE model (for mobile deployment) to DETECT eye and mouth regions AND severity: 
nstrokeEyeWeakNormal,strokeEyeMid,strokeEyeSevere, strokeMouthWeakNormal,strokeMouthMid,strokeMouthSevere.
