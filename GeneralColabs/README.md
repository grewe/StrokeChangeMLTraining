## This directory contains the base Colabs generated for detection, classification and regression training


### EyeSeverityClassificationModelMaker  
= colab to use Tensorflow Model Maker to train an EfficientNet B0 - LITE model (for mobile deployment) to classifiy Eye regions (sub-images) into : normalEye, strokeEyeWeak,strokeEyeMid,strokeEyeSevere.   Data used is located at drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12wiKdxR5jwhq5L9Mq0IVJD44YW1LuS3x 

### StrokeChange  
= colab to use Tensorflow Model Maker to train an EfficientDet D0 - LITE model (for mobile deployment) to DETECT eye and mouth regions AND severity: normalEye, strokeEyeWeak,strokeEyeMid,strokeEyeSevere, normalMouth,strokeMouthWeak,strokeMouthMid,strokeMouthSevere.
